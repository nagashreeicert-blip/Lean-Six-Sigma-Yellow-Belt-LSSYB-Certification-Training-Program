This guide contains common interview questions for LSSYB certification holders, categorized by beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels.

---

## 🟦 Beginner Level (10 Questions)

1. **What is Lean Six Sigma?**  
   **Answer:** Lean Six Sigma is a methodology combining Lean (waste elimination) and Six Sigma (reducing process variation) to improve quality and efficiency.

2. **What is a Yellow Belt?**  
   **Answer:** A Yellow Belt is an entry-level Lean Six Sigma certification holder who supports improvement projects under Green/Black Belts.

3. **What is DMAIC?**  
   **Answer:** DMAIC stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. It's the core framework used in Six Sigma projects.

4. **What is a process?**  
   **Answer:** A process is a series of steps that transform inputs into outputs to deliver value.

5. **What is waste in Lean?**  
   **Answer:** Waste is any activity that does not add value to the customer, such as overproduction, waiting, defects, motion, inventory, over-processing, and transport (TIMWOOD).

6. **What is a Kaizen event?**  
   **Answer:** A Kaizen event is a focused, short-term project aimed at improving a specific process.

7. **What is a Value Stream Map (VSM)?**  
   **Answer:** VSM is a visual tool used to analyze the flow of materials and information to identify waste and opportunities for improvement.

8. **What is the difference between Lean and Six Sigma?**  
   **Answer:** Lean focuses on eliminating waste to improve speed, while Six Sigma focuses on reducing variation to improve quality.

9. **What is a control chart?**  
   **Answer:** A control chart is a statistical tool used to monitor process performance and variation over time.

10. **Why is LSSYB certification important?**  
    **Answer:** It equips you with foundational process improvement skills, helps you actively contribute to projects, and prepares you for advanced certifications.

## 🟦 Intermediate Level (10 Questions)

1. **What are the 8 types of waste in Lean?**  
   **Answer:** TIMWOOD – Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects.

2. **What is a CTQ (Critical to Quality)?**  
   **Answer:** CTQ represents key measurable characteristics of a product or process that must meet customer requirements.

3. **What is a SIPOC diagram?**  
   **Answer:** SIPOC stands for Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers. It's used to map processes at a high level.

4. **What is process capability (Cp, Cpk)?**  
   **Answer:** Cp measures the potential capability of a process; Cpk measures actual process performance relative to specification limits.

5. **What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?**  
   **Answer:** Variance is the average squared deviation from the mean, while standard deviation is the square root of variance, showing data dispersion in original units.

6. **What is a root cause analysis?**  
   **Answer:** It is the method of identifying the primary reason for defects or problems in a process.

7. **What is a Pareto chart?**  
   **Answer:** A Pareto chart is a bar graph that identifies the most significant factors contributing to a problem based on the 80/20 rule.

8. **How does a Yellow Belt contribute to a Six Sigma project?**  
   **Answer:** Yellow Belts collect data, support process mapping, participate in Kaizen events, and assist Green/Black Belts in implementing improvements.

9. **What is a fishbone diagram?**  
   **Answer:** Also called Ishikawa diagram, it helps identify potential causes of a problem grouped by categories.

10. **What is standard work?**  
    **Answer:** Standard work defines the best-known way to perform a task consistently to achieve expected outcomes.

## 🟦 Advanced Level (10 Questions)

1. **How do you identify improvement opportunities in a process?**  
   **Answer:** By analyzing process performance, identifying waste, using VSM, and conducting root cause analysis.

2. **How do you measure process performance?**  
   **Answer:** Using key metrics like cycle time, defect rate, process capability (Cp, Cpk), and control charts.

3. **How do you differentiate between a defect and a non-conformance?**  
   **Answer:** A defect is a product or process output that fails to meet specifications, while non-conformance refers to not adhering to defined procedures or standards.

4. **How do you prioritize improvement projects?**  
   **Answer:** By evaluating impact, cost, feasibility, and alignment with business objectives, often using a prioritization matrix.

5. **How do you handle resistance to change during improvement initiatives?**  
   **Answer:** Communicate benefits clearly, involve stakeholders early, provide training, and use change management principles.

6. **What is a control plan?**  
   **Answer:** A control plan documents how process improvements will be monitored and sustained over time.

7. **How do you quantify the benefits of a process improvement?**  
   **Answer:** By measuring before-and-after metrics such as cycle time reduction, defect reduction, cost savings, and customer satisfaction.

8. **What are common challenges for Yellow Belts in Lean Six Sigma projects?**  
   **Answer:** Lack of experience, resistance from team members, data collection issues, and understanding statistical tools.

9. **What is mistake-proofing (Poka-Yoke)?**  
   **Answer:** Poka-Yoke is designing processes or tools to prevent errors or detect them immediately.

10. **How does LSSYB prepare you for Green Belt or Black Belt?**  
    **Answer:** It builds foundational skills in DMAIC, Lean tools, data analysis, and process improvement participation, forming a base for advanced certification.
